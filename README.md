# OIBSIP_TASK1
It is about the first task assigned by Oasis Infobyte  internship in the domain of DataScience
ðŸ”´ Project Overview: In this project, we tackled the classic Iris flower classification task using machine learning. Our goal was to build a model that accurately identifies three different species of Iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Key Steps ðŸ”¸ Dataset: We used the well-known Iris dataset, which contains measurements of 150 Iris flowers (50 samples from each of the three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). ðŸ”¸ Feature Selection: We focused on the four features mentioned above as predictors for classification. ðŸ”¸ Support Vector Machine (SVM):SVM is a powerful algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. It aims to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space. We trained an SVM model to distinguish between the three Iris species. ðŸ”¸ Model Evaluation: We assessed the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy. Cross-validation helped ensure robustness by evaluating the model on different subsets of the data. â—¾ Results Our SVM model achieved an accuracy of 96% on the Iris dataset. The model successfully classified Iris flowers into their respective species.
